 ARG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Crisis of 1929 forced Argentinian economy to contract, leading to lower wages, unemployment and social tension. The 1931 coup led by General Uriburu ousted president Yrigoyen from power, yet the general’s failed attempt at neocorporativism and treatment of political opposition quickly eroded his power base, forcing him to call for elections.\n\nThe Concordancia political alliance has ruled since 1932, yet it’s now four years later and the country still struggles with the effects of the Great Depression and the political turmoil it caused."
