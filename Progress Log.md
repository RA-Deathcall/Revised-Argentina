Managed to get Argentina to show as a minor nation on the “Gathering Storm” scenario.

Changed General Justo’s portrait for the real thing.
Added new National Spirit for Argentina, “Political Turmoil”, supposed to portray the effects of the Infamous Decade, gives several penalties, can be removed through National Focus Tree.
Finished flavor text for “Political Turmoil”
Finished flavor text for Argentina 1936 start.
Added National Spirit, “Saavedra Lamas Treaty”, a treaty signed after the Chaco Boreal War, decreases ability to wage offensive wars. Can be removed or reinforced by National Focus Tree.
Finished flavor text for “Saavedra Lamas Treaty”.
First balance pass on the effects of both “Political Turmoil” and “Saavedra Lamas Treaty” national spirits.
Considered political party rework for better historical accuracy. Desisted due to lack of skill on my part to actually reprogram the system.
Fixed typos.
Added new leader traits for General Justo: Civil Engineer and Misguided Patriot.
Added Saavedra Lamas as advisor along with a unique trait, Genius Negotiator, and custom portrait.
Added portraits for all party leaders.
Revised effects of Political Turmoil and Saavedra Lamas Treaty for balancing.
Added Saavdra Lamas Novel Price event. Event conditions don’t work, yet it can be triggered manually. Bypassed solving the problem in order to work on something else.
Designed a new National Focus Tree for Argentina. Turned out extremely large, cut down some foci but still remains 200% larger the average nation.
Added descriptions (flavor text) for all 130+ new foci. Lost 10% mental sanity.
Added new National Spirit, “The Roca-Runciman Trade Treaty”, which imposes penalties to industrialization and resources. Can be either revised or denounced through National Focus Tree.
Did a balance pass on all National Spirits.
Lowered Argentina’s starting national unity.
Rebalanced the “Roca-Runciman Treaty” National Spirit.
Restructured the National Focus Tree from top to bottom, making it easier to edit with Notepad ++ (now all foci are arranged in order, separated and commented).
Redistributed the OIL resource in Argentina for historical accuracy, did not change overall number as it’s consistent with historical data for the starting year.
Did first pass on the “Electoral Politics” Branch of the National Focus Tree.
Revised “Genius Negotiator” effects and description.
Added several new ideas to the list to work in tandem with the Focus Tree.
Removed all GFX for ideas until I can make them look better, decided to lower the priority of this as my artistic skills are subpar.
Did several test runs on the “Electoral Politics” Branch to check results.
On version 0.16, after a year on the Transparency route, party pops are: UCR 30, PC 29, UNF 20, Concordancia 20.
On version 0.16, after a year on the “Patriotic Fraud” route, party pops are: UCR 3, PC 0, UNF 40, Concordancia 56.
Results for the “Electoral Politics” branch deemed satisfactory for a first pass. Moved on.
Began work on “Class Struggle” Branch. Considered possibility of adding Worker Strikes event as yet another penalty National Spirit to be removed through the National Focus Tree. Saved for later in order to continue working on more pressing matters.
Finished with the effects on the “Class Struggle” branch. Frustrated at game’s limits when giving bonuses or penalties. End result far from original idea for the branch. Lack of knowledge of game mechanics hinders further improvement. End results considered functional, moved on.
Started work on the “Migration Branch”.
Finished work on the “Migration Branch”. Results are satisfactory though could be improved. Considered conditioning access to certain options depending on current ideology, left as a lower priority in order to work on something else.
Uploaded version 0.16 to Steam Workshop.
Reworked file structure to make mod compatible with others mod. Files are now named differently so as to not overwrite other possible modifications.
